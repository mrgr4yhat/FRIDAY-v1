# F.R.I.D.A.Y

#### A personal assistant written in python inspired by Iron man

 FRIDAY is a personal assistant made using Python. It is coded in a structured way so that you can easily 
 understand and modify the code for your needs. I only tested FRIDAY on windows, but it should run on other operating systems 
 if the required modules are installed.

 - Send emails via voice over (need to add in the source code)
    1. Shutdown
    2. Restart
    3. Take a screenshot
    4. Lockdown System
    & Many more.
 -  Removed Delay

 - And many more under the hood changes
