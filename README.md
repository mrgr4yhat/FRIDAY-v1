#### A personal assistant written in python inspired by IRON MAN's JARVIS

 FRIDAY is a personal assistant made using Python. It is coded in a structured way so that you can easily 
 understand and modify the code for your needs. I only tested FRIDAY on windows, but it should run on other operating systems 
 if the required modules are installed.

    2. Restart
    3. Take a screenshot
    4. Lockdown System
    & Many more.
